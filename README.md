VCDM stands for Vincenzo Consiglio Dictionary Manager. I would like to do a simple dictionary manager, example for dictionary attack attempts.

This is a very simple, stupid and incomplete dictionary manager. 
Actually it can only:
1) imports words from an ascii file
2) imports words directly from manual insert

then it saves them to dizionaro.txt file. The dictionary file is read at startup time, and saved on exit.
